Submitted program in moodle is only able to read in configuration file when configuration file is named “config.txt” and all in lowercase.Attached in this zip file is also an updated program with the correct logic for the rain chance calculation. In the previous version, I read the table given in the pdf file as ACC and then PA when it should be PA and then ACC. I switched the positions of the two and the program is displaying the correct calculations this time. I have also removed the hard-coded loop that only allows user to enter “config.txt”. This updated program is submitted to allow better usage of the program.
